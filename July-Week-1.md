# July Week 1

## To do
```
	Search Survey Tool Module
		- Search Survey
			Allows the user to search past conducted surveys from the database
			using a keyword in the survey's name via textbox and/or using a 
			range of dates when the survey was created/conducted via calendar,
			and display the results on a table. The table has 3 columns pertaining
	 		to the survey ID, the survey Name, and the survey's date of creation.

	 	- Search Result Sorting
			Allows the user to sort the resulting data in a table. It will
		  	sort the rows in ascending or descending order according to the
		  	chosen column.	

		- Select items for report generation
			Allows the user to select searched surveys and generate the
			results of the selected surveys into a file


```

	 		This took me about 5-6 hours to complete due to remaking the search logic.

## Things learned
```
	- It's better to take short bursts of work and take breaks than to
	  do all the work at once, it may take longer than usual but it's
	  less tiring.
```

## Hardest task done this week
```
	- Redo-ing the Search Survey function. This led to also redo-ing of almost half
	  of my code. The one who helped me in this predicament was my supervisor, who 
	  provided some tips on how to make the search function better.
