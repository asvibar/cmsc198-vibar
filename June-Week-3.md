# June Week 3

## To do
```
	Maintenance Form
		- I was tasked to create a dynamic webpage that would allow a user to
		record and add configurations that will be used for the website's
		front end. This was the only task that was revealed for this module.

		*This task will be done alone.


```

## Done
```
	 Maintenance Form View
	  	- It took about 1 hour to do this task. The page should be able to display
	  	what has been recorded in the database.

	 Add input data to database 
	  	- It took about 2 - 3 hours to complete this task. The page should be able to
	  	record user input from the form and the default values, in case the user did
	  	not put any input.
	 
```

## To be done
```
	CSS
		- The webpage I have created has no design elements yet.

	Error Catching / User Input Validation
		- Add input to database has yet to validate the user input. 
```

## Things learned
```
	- Studying does not stop at graduation.
```
## Hardest task done this week
```	
	Understanding the words and terminologies used in the working field/ environment. They used some business terms, that I have not, or have yet to learn. This lead to some errors
	that I have made during this week's development. Asking questions and research made me help
	correct my errors.
